Converts a 3D TIFF file to raw data.  The TIFF must use the 'directory' feature
to store each slice of the image plane.

This code will convert it into a raw data file, and create a small little nrrd
header to go along with that.  The conversion is done completely out-of-core;
you should only need enough memory to load a single scanline at any one time.
